# CryptDash

I developed Cryptdash, a website that showcases the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap, featuring real-time data on price, percentage change, market cap, and volume, sourced from the CoinGecko API. I designed and implemented a comprehensive detail page for each cryptocurrency, providing extensive information including price performance, circulating supply, and official links. Additionally, I created an interactive chart using Highcharts on the detail page to display cryptocurrency price trends over the past 1 day, 7 days, 1 month, and 3 months. The technologies used for this project include HTML, CSS, React, HighCharts, Material UI, and JavaScript.
